Their blue cheeses and ranch dressings are so good, they are defiantly worth mention. We tried the large combo pizza and it was good, but I think it would have been outstanding if we had eaten at the restaurant. It ended up a bit wet and soggy from the time in the box, So next time I do take out, I'll get something simpler like cheese or pepperoni and maybe in a smaller size to avoid the sog. I can tell the pizza crust is fermented/proofed a day or more, it is truly outstanding. I am looking forward eating at the restaurant and trying their calzone and lasagna!\",\n",

I might have liked it more had they taken the time to observe what pizza was being eaten and made more of that.\\u00a0 There were always pizzas with weird ingredients that no one wanted.\\u00a0 I wish they had just stuck with the basics like pepperoni and sausage.\\u00a0 You cannot go wrong with those.  Very busy and tight quarters to navigate the salad bar, pizza bar and restaurant in general.  Needless to say, it is not something I will be back for, but we came and saw.\\u00a0 I give it a strong 'meh'.\",\n",

This dish was good/ok, but nothing special (gnocchi enthusiasts should try Solera and Second Home). When we go back (because we will) we'll try one of the other pasta dishes that looked delicious on other tables. Overall, very strong!\",\n",

I sat for at least 5 mins without a glance from any staff. A couple was seated fairly close and they were encountered within 30 seconds. I decided to get up and walk out. The hostess approached me but I shook my head and left.  A number of empty tables so not sure why they treat lone diners as red headed stepchildren\",\n",

I had the chicken rigatoni with the Maggiano Salad and grilled asparagus side dish.The house red wine was not that great, but all the food excellent. Among the appetizers we sampled, I would not get the calamari or stuffed mushrooms again, but both flatbreads we tried were excellent. Overall restores my faith that there are some good chain restaurants.\",\n",

I didn't like the \\\"Big Apple Mule,\\\" as I felt the tart apple didn't go well with the ginger beer flavor. The Moscow mules were delicious, however, and came in copper mugs.  The food is delicious! They have \\\"pizza rolls\\\" made of pesto, salami, and mozzarella with a balsamic reduction on the side. So delicious! The flavors perfectly blended together. Their \\\"best appetizer\\\" (according to my dinner mates) is the limoncello wings. Tart, sweet, and garlicky, they were pretty good! The spinach and artichoke dip disappointed a little. There was less cheese and much less garlic than the kind of dip we're used to. The pita slices that came with it were pillowy and an excellent complement. The Nutella pizza was the chewy pita bread stuffed with melted Nutella. A tasty way to end a happy hour!\",\n",

The food was mostly good, but several dishes missed on flavor or execution. (My partner quite enjoyed the gnocchi in rabbit ragu, however.)  Overall there were two primary issues:\\u00a0 1) It was a four-course menu and the first three plates were *enormous*. Each course was a full meal in itself. By the second half of the menu diners are forced either to waste huge amounts of food or stuff themselves beyond the ability to enjoy the next course. 2) The sheer amount of food translates to high prices. The two of us had the prix fixe menu and a glass of wine each. After tip it was a $240 meal - and simply not worth it at that price.  Again, the food was mostly good and I imagine the typical daily dining experience there is enjoyable.\",\n",

My husband got the four cheese ravioli, and I got angel hair with marinara. The marinara was perfectly seasoned, and coupled with the delicate angle hair, it was easily one of the best pasta dishes I've had. They had a buy one take one deal going on where we got one dish in the restaurant and one to take home, which is a great deal. Overall, one of my new favorites.\",\n",

Excellent ambience - the whole restaurant was beautifully decorated with christmas items. The food is great, the Italian flatbread and stuffed mushrooms were good. I went for shrimp scampi which was good too. They didn't put extra marinara on my spagetti like some other joints. I also tasted the ravioli pasta with chicken and it was pretty good. The signature cocktails were average and nothing to be ecstatic about. Staff were friendly but the service was pretty slow. We had to wait for nearly 45 mins to get our appetizers on plate. Definitely worth visiting.\",\n",

I recommend this place to everyone...but that may be done. The sauce was a salt lick without any other substantial flavor. So salty that the tomatoes were overpowered. I bragged about how they don't overcook the pasta to my guests and then was served linguine so mushy that one could not twirl it without it breaking. No one ate but a few bites. Now I have a $27 plate of leftovers that no one here will eat. What a waste! Normally, I would give this place 4.8 stars. I really should give them less than two this time. Horrible waste of my loyalty and my money...and I still want to eat dinner, just not this.\",\n",

The melted mozzarella appetizer was just what it sounds like ... melted cheese in a bowl with bread , was not impressed by it . This place was far from being bad but also not mind blowing . With that being said I'd come back if I was on this side of town. Also great happy hour menu !\",\n",

Virgilio's is the micro food of Italian food. \\u00a0It's proprietor, Virgilio Mario Urbano, grew up 20 minutes from me in CT and I never knew him even though we went to some of the same pizza joints. \\u00a0Back in that day a real Italian mom and pop place was where you got VERY good pizza, as a child you couldn't even begin to realize just how good it was until you had bad pizza. \\u00a0Mass producing food has brutalized our taste buds and the result is occasionally seeing a bad review about places like Virgilios from people who's taste buds no longer have the ability to tell us what is truly good. So, with home made mozzarella on their margherita pizza and home made sauce on all their pizzas and the most fresh and flavourful toppings Virgilio's is truly Colorado's best pizza, at least the way Neopolitano's made it in Italy. \\u00a0When USA Today said it's #1 there really is no argument. \\u00a0My family and I LOVE going to Virgilio's even though my waistline suffers a little. \\u00a0 If you go take advantage of the garlic knots, the fresh melted mozzarella with prosciutto de parm and toast, and make sure that have a glass of some of the wonderful riserva wines.\",\n",

Perfectly split between being outside and in . I ordered the Italian grinder which was phenomenal. I loved that they didn't serve it on a regular hoagie like most places. It was served with fried potatoes with parmesean cheese sprinkled all over them. My boyfriend got the chicken parmigiano which was also put of this world. Instead of the chicken being served over spaghetti they put it over more of an Alfredo sauce with penne pasta, but it wasn't too rich. It was the perfect combination of red and white sauce mixed. We also had the meatballs as an appetizer which came with about six meatballs in a plate, very good. The meatball appetizer made me assume the meatball sandwich is good too. I recommend this place to everyone. Great Italian food with more of an original take. Will Def be back again.\",\n",

I recently received a flyer announcing that they now deliver so I placed an order. I was disappointed. Disappointed to the point where I felt I needed to share this feedback. \\r The pizza delivered was lukewarm and soggy and the salad was not the one I ordered. \\r The Lil Ricci's I ordered from is literally within walking distance of my home but Lil Ricci's could not manage to deliver the pizza hot. It also appeared that the pizza had been stood on its side, the toppings thick in places and the crust bare in others. I would have been better off with a frozen pie from the supermarket. Delivering the wrong salad is just plain shoddy service. \\r If you enjoy the restaurant my recommendation is to avoid ordering their delivery.\",\n",

We ordered an appetizer and two main meals. When my husband got home, we noticed that our appetizer was missing. I called and spoke to the hostess Carly who was very rude and said we could either come pick up the appetizer or come in tomorrow to be refunded. I thought this was unacceptable and insisted on speaking to the manager who was able to refund me over the phone. My husband and I then sat down to eat and I immediately noted that the spaghetti and marinara I had ordered was in meat sauce (I do not eat meant). I once again called back and had the pleasure of speaking to Carly. She placed me on hold for 10 minutes and then got back on saying the manager was busy (likely because they were screwing up other orders). She then told me I could come in tomorrow for our refund. At that time I insisted on speaking to the manager once again since he was able to refund me previously. Carly then pleasantly hung the phone up on me. Terrible customer service and we will NEVER go back there. CARLY IS RUDE, CLUELESS AND SHOULD BE FIRED. Avoid this restaurant at all costs as there are much better italian restaurants with much better customer service. Thank you Armandos and especially CARLY for ruining our Valentine's day.\",\n",

He was cordial as he pointed to the table and said \\\"enjoy!\\\" We quickly realized that 5 of us were seated at a square 4 place table. We moved to an adjacent open round table for 5 or 6 and began to sit, when the owner came storming over and shouted \\\"hey, you can't sit there!\\\" I stood and explained that we certainly could not fit at the square 4 top table where were originally seated. He stepped toward me and rudely announced \\\"If you don't like that table, you can go back in line and wait another 45 minutes for a table!\\\" We were surprised and needless to say very disappointed by this reaction. My family was so upset, I could not convince them to stay.\\r Over several years, we have dined here and made it our special place for business guests and family for a very enjoyable meal with nice service.

While the food's blandness is comparable to anything found in public school cafeterias or nursing-homes, this establishment is a great place to take a large group of people with undiscerning taste buds as the servers are amiable and patient. If you think The Godfather is an accurate depiction of Italian culture, you will probably enjoy this restaurant.\",\n",

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  While they'll get you on the beers when it comes to price, what else is new for a labeled Brewery. However, the pizza, and in my case the calzone, was very reasonably priced, with only $9.50 scoring me this monstrosity.  Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Pizza is pretty straight-forward yeah? Crust, Sauce, Cheese, Toppings. Done. That's hard to mess up, but at the same time? It's difficult to master. My calzone was great, full of fresh ingredients, and others in my party were absolutely raving about their pizzas. However, I can't say it was the best I've ever had. Single Star Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  This is a tough one, but the concept is such a great one that I have to admit that Il Vicino would be on my lunch list every day if I lived downtown. Star Granted.\",\n",

Couldn't have been more disappointed. To start, you order standing at the desk like a fast food joint. You aren't even waited on. Considering the $80 meal, we should get more than McDonalds service. Then, the pizzas ordered had crust that was vastly undercooked. All told we ordered three pizzas, bread, a full salad, and a calzone, and of the table of 6 of us we are less than half and took nothing home. Truly disappointed. We won't ever be back.\",\n",

Try this amazing pizza joint in Old Colorado City! The area caters to the more liberal \\\"free-spirits\\\" and appears to be very dog-friendly.  Plan extra time to find parking anywhere in this area. Pizzeria Rustica is a small, quaint pizza restaurant that serves up an assortment of pizzas, liquors, salads, and Italiano appetizers and desserts.  Since everything is made to order and fresh, you will have plenty of time to converse with friends or impress you date. My soul-mate and I enjoyed dinner here on a Saturday evening around 730pm and it was full of diverse guests.  Families, children, twosomes, and a couple dogs in the patio seating area.  Although reservations are not needed, if you expect to bring large party of friends or are celebrating an event--I would call to secure seating! The host was sweet and accommodating and promptly sat us on the patio as requested.  The waitress Chelsea was patient and knowledgeable about the menu and was hustling to ensure she catered to her assigned tables.  Her recommendations were on point and I started my night off right with the Raspberry Cosmopolitan & the roasted olives and nuts on flatbread.  Delicious!  The aroma here is divine...garlic, cheese and pizza crust!  As soon as our pizza were served, the patrons beside us had googly-eyes for the delicious pizza and wanted to know what we ordered.  Folks, the pizzas were so flavorful--one of the best I have had--with fresh veggies & savory spices. You will have a couple slices leftover for a night-time snack.  Desserts are all Italiano-based so much of it is coffee-flavored and exotic. Definitely a must try for Colorado Springs!\",\n",

I grew up working in excellent Italian places, so I might be a little hard to please.  I will say they always have exceptional service and I have always had good meals.  The squid ink pasta and lobster was my favorite.  Of note were the crab cake appetizers.  After living for a bit in Maryland, I quit ordering crab when not back there.  I took a gamble and ordered the crab cakes tonight.  Pretty sure they weren't blue crab, but outside of Baltimore, they were absolutely the best I've ever had; fresh real chunk crab perfectly cooked.  All in all, a solid date night spot.\",\n",

We all know the old saying: \\\"you can fool some of the people some of the time...\\\" Well, this time Biaggi's Ristorante Italiano is not fooling me. This wildly popular Italian style restaurant draws a lot of out of town visitors, lunchtime business diners, and even small group patrons. It is packed on the weekends, in particular. Located in the convenient oasis of The Shoppes at Briargate among the the other themed chains and popular shopping storefronts, is what seems to be a venerable location for an always dependable meal. Sadly, things have changed. The greeting staff, comprised of two or three young ladies focused more on creating an air of exclusivity rather than getting folks to their table as efficiently as possible, are a bit too full of themselves for this typically laid-back Colorado clientele. The ambiance is somewhat upscale, though a little sterile with that distinctive \\\"shopping mall\\\" formulaic feel. I have been here about ten times over the past several years, and have noticed a decidedly steep decline in service and food quality. My wife and I were here for a 'pre-Valentine rush' dinner, and so were most other diners. Our server, though genuinely well-intentioned, was stilted, confused, and struggling the entire evening. He took forever to bring us some water, then our drinks, and even jammed us with our soup and salads all at once. Clearly, he was not properly trained. I ordered the 'Olive Me' martini with stuffed olives and Bombay Gin. It was way under portioned, barely reaching the middle of the glass, and missing the added vermouth I requested. The olives were a nice touch though, as all three were filled with either blue cheese, anchovies, or pepperoni. It was a welcomed twist on my usual three olive standby. My wife had a dry Californian Pinot Grigio that she thoroughly enjoyed. The special soup for the evening was a wonderful white asparagus with pur\\u00e9ed carrots and root vegetables in a perfectly balanced cream base. Understated, bright and flavorful, it was the best part of the meal. The Caesar salad was heavily dressed, loaded with shaved Parmesan and most memorable for the undertone of biting and bitter spice from a strong, peppery chili sauce of some kind. Perhaps it appeals to the nouveau palate, but not ours. My wife's sea scallops were served seared and aligned on a tiny layer of creamy risotto, flaked with crabmeat, but unfortunately ringed with an overpowering, super garlicky basil pesto that supplanted any hope of the scallop flavor from shining through. It was a heavy-handed, clumsy attempt at what should have been a better contrived dish. My eggplant Parmesan was equally disappointing. The large slices of eggplant were so thick that they did not cook through and were still green on the edges, and way over battered and too chewy to eat. The so-called tomato cream sauce, was super thick, pasty, and brash with a distinctive acidic flavor, but void of any actual cream. The topping Parmesan cheese spent too much time under the Salamander Broiler and was charred to black, instead of a more appealing light brown. Even the side of their signature Sicilian meatballs were very tough, undercooked with pink sausage pork vividly evident in the middle of one, and each needing to be ground more finely during the preparation. The concept of using what was an admittedly delicious, spicy sausage base, was ruined by terrible execution of a simple rustic meatball. The result was a complete fail on this dish. Our bill was $75 before tip, and the meal turned out to be frustratingly mediocre for a place that purports to serve sophisticated Italian fare. Others continue to flock to Biaggi's, so it is entirely possible we could be missing something in the translation. But I doubt it. Salut!\",\n",

Neither time did the manager apologize or take anything off the bill!!!!! The first time we went, the food was cold and the hostess was super rude. The service at this place is SLOW and poor... We tried it a third time, because once the food arrives, it is actually pretty decent. But the slow service, lack of attention and constant mistakes are not worth a return trip.\",\n",

Going in I thought I'd found a gem - getting true New York style pizza in Colorado - but then this was quite a disappointment. I took the pizza home & even though I kept it on my seat by the time I got home the toppings were all over the place. This means the cheese & the toppings weren't baked in fully. The taste wasn't all that great either, probably on par or lower than Dominos.  I felt this place was just as expensive, if not more, than the pizza places in New York. So all-in-all it wasn't the best experience.\",\n",

They have two registers but decided to only use one and of course a family of four in front of me doesn't know what they want and they hold the other three people behind them up. The guy in front of me was also picking up a pizza. After we waited in line for 15 minutes he stated \\\"my wife loves there pizza but they have the worst customer service.\\\" I feel the same way. I like Richard Skorman, his politics, and what he does for our community but I will NOT BE BACK to Poor Richards. If they develop a system of picking up a pizza I might consider it but until then I will be going elsewhere.\",\n",

After being in town for a week for a conference and staying at a nearby hotel I was delighted to stumble across poor Richards restaurant, cafe, and shops. I have been here nearly every day whether it be for a used book, pizza (twice!), or coffee and coconut macaroons. Pizza is excellent- the crust is just the right amount of chewy and crunchy. The menu has many vegetarian/vegan friendly options with apparent fresh ingredients. Their bakery items are delicious.   I was also very impressed with the service. People seemed to really take pride in providing a good customer experience, were friendly, and worked quickly to churn out orders during a steady dinner hour. The atmosphere is terrific as well. They have several patios (front and back) and a relaxed ambiance inside. One of the nights I was here there was acoustic music. I will be mentioning this place anytime I ever hear any mention of 'colorado springs' and will remember it as a wonderful part of my trip to Co springs! I urge you to head to poor Richards NOW!!\",\n",

Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  It looks like other Yelpers have experienced some issues with the service, but my server was very pleasant. From there, the atmosphere is great, with abundant space and some unique grocery items that aren't common in a Safeway or King Soopers. My sandwich came out quick, so no complaints here. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  When I hop into a local deli, I'm expecting to pay a bit more than say Subway or Jimmy John's. This being the case, I didn't give it a second thought when my Pastrami Sandwich came to $8.18.  Huge? No. Heavy on the meat? Not really, but you get a small side salad with your sandwich, which saved the day here portion wise. Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  While my sandwich was good, I can't say the meat or the bread was better than what I've had in the past. The bread was beaten out by nearby South Jersey Subs, and the meat didn't have me wishing I'd ordered a second. Single Star Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Nah. With Drifter's, Chipotle, etc. so close, this really isn't anything special. No Star Granted.\",\n",

I first ate here about four or five years ago and it as been a while since I have returned. Nothing has changed really, except for the prices, which are dizzyingly high for the freshly cut cold cuts. How they can demand 22 bucks a pound for provolone cheese is beyond my comprehension...who's paying that? Anyway, the Italian subs are still relatively high quality, made with fresh, chewy bread, fine cold cuts, and just the right amount of dressing. It is their staple product and is still among the very best in the city. The sausages are homemade, authentic and pricey at 10 bucks for five with marinara sauce. I get the need to remain committed to quality, but these are not proper, old school, in-shop, hanging aged meat from the ceiling, deep village Brooklyn Italian Deli products these folks are selling. They are mere Boar's Head commercial products in most cases--though a handful are imported. I get frustrated by price gouging and found any other offerings besides the sub sandwiches, which are already pretty sporty at nearly 10 bucks each, as way too expensive for real people to afford. I cannot grasp how they stay in business with that kind of a pricing structure. Therefore I recommend we as consumers stay focused as well, and stick exclusively to the sub sandwiches at Mollica's, otherwise you will find yourself overspending for mediocrity.\",\n",

Having wanted to try what Mollicas was all about, and having visited them twice before only to find they were closed, I finally hit paydirt on Monday this week. My wife was at work, so that left me with baby duty with the twins. Coming inside, I had one in each hand, but was gratefully helped by the busser who seemed to be the most helpful and friendly person on the staff. I say this because all other workers (who I'm sure are paid more than the busser) stood and stared as I went about my business trying to get some high chairs ready at my table.\\r \\r After that was all settled, I went to the counter to order. I noticed a large assortment of subs available in 4\\\" (around $4) and 8\\\" variety. Each came with a side of pasta salad unless you wanted something different (I don't know what else they had). So I ordered the two subs they're most famous for, the Grinder (sausage) and the Dominic (meatballs), a drink and a large cannoli. The sandwiches came out very hot, with perfectly crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside bread. The meat for both (which is made in house) was absolute perfection. The freshness permeates throughout as you can taste each spice used to make their meat. Speaking of the sausage and meatballs, I must have been eating a lot of crappy pre-made storebought stuff in other restaurants because these meats just melted in my mouth. Literally requiring no chewing. The tomato sauce used was equally as fresh with no salt or sugar trying to hide or take away what is just a naturally good sauce.\\r \\r The pasta salad was just okay, nothing good or bad to say about it. Well, except they used a small amount of red onions which I hate. But to be honest, it came with so little that I didn't care. My only comment on the cannoli is their extremely reasonable prices when compared to Dat's Italian for literally half the price ($3.50 versus $6.89). I could taste no difference.\\r \\r So in the end, I would definitely recommend Mollicas to the discerning Italian sub enthusiast. So far, I can't find another place in town that touches them.\\r \\r As a final note, the prices noted here on Urbanspoon have all gone up since the menu was last posted. My meal came to a total of $15.01 for everything I talked about when all was said and done.\",\n",

There were 5 of us, we were seated at a table for 4 with a chair on the end which put me into the aisle with people walking by bumping me constantly. Put in our order and waited 40 minutes for the food to arrive, during which time the server and the manager came by and apologized multiple times without us complaining about the wait. Food was marginal, I ordered the \\\"late night burger\\\" which was advertised as \\\"smothered\\\" with chile verde, when it arrived there was barely any on it, certainly not smothered. I sent the server back for more twice before it was acceptable. Then the gift card I had was run incorrectly so I had to pay cash out of pocket for no reason. I won't go back to BJ's at any point in the future. Not worth the trouble or expense.\",\n",

The place was clean and neat. From there the expeeience falls off the cliff. There were 4 of us and we all spent a great deal of time looking over the large menu. I, as is my norm, wanted to go straight for the signature of the place. It actually took some reading to figure out it was a deep dish pizza type place. I ordered BJ's favorite mini and added a Cesar salad. For being a signature dish I was grealty disappointed. There is no sauce, most if the fillings seemed under cooked and had no real flavor at all. It honestly paired right up there with a dry sandwich. The salad was okay bust some of the lettuce was slimy. My wife ordered the broccoli cheese soup. It was barely Luke warm and truthfully tasted like microwaved canned soup. By her third spoon it was cold. My sons opted for differnt choices one with a steak and the other a chicken club sandwich... lets just say the veggies and fries were cold, the mashed potatoes tasted like food service boil in a bag type and the fries had a hint of fish to them. All toll we spent $64 (no alcohol) before tip and honestly we all left feeling a bit peckish. Just wasn't impressed at all. My advice, hit noodles and company across the parking lot for an $8 thai hot pot or buttered noodles.\",\n",

Breaking into that cultural echelon is not easy for new businesses and product lines. BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is awfully familiar and reminiscent of several other similar brew pubs and houses I have frequented lately. It is built in a warehouse structure with faux side panels, garage door windows and partitions and an industrial ceiling. There is a decidedly recurring theme of the obligatory list of six or eight selections of house Pilsners, IPA's, Porters and Lagers, each described by bitterness and hoppyness and color and caramel. BTW, am I the only one who thinks $7 for a unremarkable draught beer is bit much? Methinks the charm and luster of all these supposedly exclusive craft beers has worn off, as they are becoming rather ordinary and overpriced. I can get an equally satisfying six pack of Sam Adams' for a few dollars more. The related menu typically offers some peppery calamari, spicy fries, cheesy chips, creamy pastas, and smoky meats. They all have variations on the same theme, with desperately few offering their own opus to a memorable experience. Sure, these places are fun and sociable, but they have also become routine and predictable as a springtime snow fall in Denver. I'll go down the list to satisfy those who want to know how the rundown of pub food actually measured up. The calamari, with marinara and horseradish dippers were fine, salty, crispy and made fresh to order--though a bit skimpy in portion for the price. The fettuccine with chicken and broccoli and the shrimp scampi with linguine are adequate, perfectly satisfying but certainly nothing special. The New York sirloin is a fair price and can be paired with some very good Brussels sprouts with bacon lardons. The burgers are mediocre and cooked properly, while the pulled pork is a reheated, though sufficiently tangy sandwich topped with limp onion strings and a conflictingly sweeter commercial bbq sauce that seems to clash with the more vinegary pork sopping marinade. Each of those are sided with joltingly fishy tasting skinny fries that are served cold, meaning they are not enjoyable at all. They need to rotate the fryolator oil. The all you can eat soup and salad for eight bucks is good, but the tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad was not made consistently: the first one was adroitly dressed with basil, a drizzle of a fine syrupy balsamic, and some fresh greens; the second was overpowered with an ill-advised array of thyme, cilantro and other off-putting herbs. There was no buffalo mozzarella added, and the tomatoes were not as flavorful on the second round. It was horrible, and simply not consistent. Someone has not been trained properly, to include the server who put it on our table without challenging the line cook regarding the inconsistency. The clam chowder, though jammed full of clam bits, was a little too thick with a flour based roux. The kid's pan pizza was doughy and had no sauce or topping worth mentioning. Subsequently, BJRBH barely rises above the most basic of standards for acceptable, and is simply another average franchise that will do if your hungry. Whatever.\",\n",

The lady who seated me was also my waitress. She was very attentive and took my order right away. The menu entry for chicken parmigiana described as \\\"Breaded Chicken Tenders.......\\\" So I ordered the lasagna and asked what the soup(s) were since I am not a salad fan. She had to go and check and it was clam chowder. The clam chowder was actually very rich and thick and I enjoyed it. The lasagna was in a little dish by itself and was probably made to order. The dish was sizzling when it arrived, but the cheese had not browned leading me to believe that a microwave was involved. The marinara sauce was rich and flavorful, and there was a lot of it. I would have enjoyed having more meat and pasta but oh well. The dish itself was OK, but not what I hoped for. I cannot say like or dislike at this point and will probably never eat here again due to living in another state.\",\n",

I'm very bummed about this, I gave it another try tonight and the same, all salt, I also think it tasted more acidic. There is also Alot of new staff in there that just try real hard and you cannot enjoy your meal and a conversation without someone at your table every two minutes, please bring the original sauce back!\",\n",

He knew the specials by heart and provided excellent recommendations to suit our palettes.  The portions were spot-on with freshly baked bread accompaniment.  With any restaurant that serves freshly made pasta, you will have an opportunity to sip wine and enjoy your date's company.  This is a great date night location or venue for a small group of friends.  It appears they also do catered events.  Everyone's food including my own was absolutely divine.

Restaurant ambiance is quaint, simple and clean with poster size family photos. Great for friends or coworkers, casual date or if you just want to order & pick-up.  The pizzas are tasty and fresh with focus on a selective specialty menu.  There is something for everyone (meat-eaters and vegetarians).  If you want to add-on additional toppings, that option is available.  Duca also has piadine's and salads.  Service was friendly and helpful.  One individual pizza serves 1 adult (you may have a slice or 2 leftover). Great food for a great price!\",\n",

The pizza is a really great value at 6.95 for a pie that will feed two! The Mediterranean salad was fantastic. \\r \\r The bad:\\r \\r Desserts were a joke. Not fresh. \\\"Gelato\\\" was a frozen solid pre packaged cup of ice cream like you get at a school cafeteria. Caloni pretty terrible, likely out of a box. This place is not a bakery/cafe.\\r \\r No bar. No wine list. Just a couple mediocre hoise wines and a few beers.\\r \\r Atmosphere: this is the most disappointing part....think slightly nicer version of Subway. Self serve. Bright lights. Not the kind of place that invites you to sit and stay awhile. \\r \\r Bottom line: authentic, well done Napoli style pizza at a great price...great salads, but take it to go.\",\n",

Most restaurants I see people working together and maybe socializing, but the aura and vibes here are great! The food is absolutely delicious; I have tried so many different items and never know which one to choose the next time since they all are so good. The beers on tap are always rotating and always fun to try. Couldn't really ask for more!\",\n",

Due to the mixed reviews we wanted to take a look at their buffet before deciding wether or not we wanted to stay and eat here (not to mention that one of us is a vegetarian). We went in and saw that there were 3 peices of a very stale looking cheese pizza and some other pasta dishes that looked as if there had been there since lunch, we were there around 6pm. We decided not to eat there and went out to our car, to look for another place to eat. It was then that this guy came out and started starting at us. This person then said \\\"I noticed you guys left\\\". I said \\\"Yes we didn't see any pizzas and don't have time to wait and noticed 4 people in the restaurant and decided to eat somewhere else\\\". It was then that this guy started yelling, and approaching the open window of my vehicle, that the other people ordered their own pizzas and he was making more. Again, we didn't have time. Then preceded to insult the Navy plates that are on my vehicle, and started screaming that Air Force is better. Not even sure where that came from, but whatever. Good luck to anyone that decides to eat at this establishment.\",\n",

I called and ordered this for carry out, go to pickup my order and there was a balance, the owner wanted to charge me gratuity for my carry out order, was mad I got it for carry out, said that was an error and wanted to charge me over the amount it said it was valued at.

He then proceeded to interrogate us on what we were going to order and how much money we planned to spend insisting he needed to make money off of us even though the Groupon didn't state we had to spend a minimum amt of $. Had he given us a chance to order, he would have known how much we were spending. Plus, the buffet was kind of pricey for the small amount of stale food they had to offer.

The Jambalaya is almost $17 but based on portion size and flavor it shouldn't cost more then $14. The pizza is average - flavors are all really great but crust is kinda dry. Macaroni bites suck! They are not even close to the Cheesecake Factory ones. We really enjoy all the pasta dishes and would consider CPK a place we would eat at every few months.\",\n",

We stopped going there because my wife and I considered the food overpriced and underwhelming. Generally, that remains our impression of CPK 's current offerings. The field green salad was underdressed, bland, and needed some tang. The sweet walnuts were very good though. The Bolognese was skimpy on the sauce, too light and bright for what supposed to be a hearty, rich dish. It had no depth of flavor, lacked garlic, and the pasta was actually way too al dente and almost inedible. The wild mushroom pizza was dominated with fresh basil and a pungent wild mushroom flavor. It was surprisingly bold but did not balance with the near tasteless crust. The five cheese pizza was good, but also needed some salt and pepper and maybe some oregano to round it out. I tried their pricey sangria and it was refreshing..not to mention pricey. CPK's prices are still astronomical for what they serve you, and we were once again reminded why we do not like the food, nor consider their prices a value for the average family. We will not return anytime soon.\",\n",

You can expect a trendy interior, a large, varied menu and a formal waitstaff. \\r \\r The CPK specializes in \\\"personalized\\\" pizza's that ring in around 12\\\" in diameter and have toppings you wouldn't normally find at other pizza places. Just look at my Thai pizza for example. No tomato sauce here, instead, it's a peanut sauce. It comes with scallions, chicken, sprouts, etc. It was pretty tasty with all of the flavors going nicely and reminding me of, guess what, Pad Thai.\\r \\r My wife's 3 topping pizza was also pretty good. The sauce was just enough and had the traditional California style sweet sauce. The sausage had nice, noticeable fennel seeds in it, which made it seem more premium.\\r \\r I like their traditional crust, which was crunchy and very chewy with a slight hint of sweetness to it. I really enjoyed it. And best of all, it wasn't dusted with that damn corn meal like Extreme Pizza does.\\r \\r I'd recommend CPK to people who would insist on a chain restaurant, but also because I don't believe there is a local pizza joint that specializes in California Style pizza in the Springs.\",\n",

Colorado Springs Food Guy visited Panino\\u2019s 1721 S 8th St, Colorado Springs CO 80905 based on a suggestion from one of my Facebook friends. Panino\\u2019s is a casual, family-style restaurant with an upbeat atmosphere. I sampled their most popular item, the Grinder Panino, along with the Barbeque Panino, Manicotti, and the Italian Platter. The Grinder and Barbecue Paninos are overstuffed, lightly toasted wraps filled with an assortment of meats, and other flavorful ingredients. The Manicotti was baked to perfection. The Italian Platter offered generous portions of old-style Italian favorites such as Lasagna, Eggplant Parmigiana, and Spaghetti with Meatballs. Brian was my server and he was very attentive and energetic. The Manager and host were very welcoming, making it no wonder why this restaurant has become a staple in the community for so many years. I also tried an Italian Margarita served over ice with a salty rim.\\u00a0 It was mixed perfectly and delicious. Simply, Panino\\u2019s does family-style Italian right with reasonable prices, big portions, and scrumptious food. \\u00a0So next time you want a family night out in search of a hearty meal, visit Panino\\u2019s. I had a wonderful dining experience.\",\n",

This little cafe style restaurant reminds me of hitting the little Trattorias in Italy. They have a nice small patio out front and the inside is light and modern with wood floors, just enough art and the tables are nicely spaced. After having not so great 'Italian' food the other night I was still craving some good pasta. The night was a bit cool so we opted to sit inside and were seated in a little alcove by the window which made for a great 'date' night spot. Often these tucked away tables can be forgotten but not here. Our waitress Kelsey was so nice, friendly and helpful all night and not just to us but to all her tables.  \\u00a0  The place was packed with several large parties on a Thursday night but as we walked to our table the food looked amazing. Lucky for us we were hungry so got to try a good sampling of the food.  We started off with a bottle of the Fantini Farnese Sangiovese. Deep ruby color with notes of leather, cherry, cranberry, tobacco and earth aromas; dry, medium-bodied, with velvety texture and ripe cherry flavors. It was a great choice in the mid-price range. I will be adding a few bottles of this to my own collection. Kelsey also brought out some wonderful bread, fresh from the oven with a nice crispy exterior and their house-made balsamic dipping sauce. A great start!  Dare we say after a terrible Caesar salad that we decided to give it a whirl for a second night in a row. Whew, glad we did. This was a nice big bowl meant for sharing with crisp romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese and croutons with a wonderful light dressing (and not too much or too little) with a hint of anchovies. I asked for a side of anchovies and was quickly brought a small bowl of them. Another thing I really liked about the service here was that we were brought salad plates AND forks. A pet peeve (as a former server) is using your entree fork and then it either not being replaced or the server asking you to keep it. Nice touch.  The absolute highlight and I mean highlight is the pizza. It is days later and I am still thinking about that pizza. We ordered a bar size Godfather as an appetizer. Olive Oil, Roasted Garlic, Mozzarella, Ricotta Cheeses and Bella Spices plus we added chicken and mushrooms. That Ricotta cheese knocked this pizza out of the park. Super thin crust (I usually leave the ends...not this time) and I was amazed that the center was as crispy as the outside (usually the outside is crispy and the inside is a bit soggy). I wish we had ordered the large! It came with cute bowls of Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. This pizza is straight from Italy...HEAVEN. They also have a Gluten Free crust for those that are interested. Hands down to date the best pizza in the Springs area.  We came hungry and I mean hungry so we both ventured onto the pasta side. I opted for the Sicilian Style Beef Cannelloni which was Beef Braised in Red Wine, Stuffed into Pasta and Baked in a Tomato and Roasted Vegetable Sauce with Bechamel. My, oh, my..the red wine sauce was so deep and rich with fork tender beef encased in a sheet of perfectly cooked pasta. I ate half, took half home put an egg on top for breakfast the next day. Again, to showcase the great service, Kelsey had put 2 pieces of the bread in the to-go container. Top notch throughout the whole experience.  My hubby had the spaghetti combo with homemade meatballs and Italian sausage. The meatballs were delicious. Moist, perfectly seasoned and held up wonderfully in the homemade marinara sauce. The sausage was your typical Italian sausage with a good hint of fennel (we want to try this on the pizza next time). The red sauce was fresh and had a perfect balance. Not too acidic and with a hint of sweetness. The pasta was cooked to perfection. They also have a full line of Gluten Free pasta items to choose from.  \\u00a0I know all the desserts are homemade but we were packed and called it a very happy night. It is worth the drive and even a wait for this Italian food and exceptional service.\",\n",

Also, the garlic knots that I ordered were doughy and undercooked.  I sent an email to the email address they have listed on their website for comments/complaints (webmaster@borriellobrothers.com)  and attached a picture of my deflated calzone, but never received any type of response.  Very disappointed considering how much my order cost.  The lack of caring that they effed up my order determined that I'll never eat at any  Borriello Brothers again.\",\n",

While the food's blandness is comparable to anything found in public school cafeterias or nursing-homes, this establishment is a great place to take a large group of people with undiscerning taste buds as the servers are amiable and patient. If you think The Godfather is an accurate depiction of Italian culture, you will probably enjoy this restaurant.\",\n",

Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  Friendly staff, lightning fast service, and a great indoor/outdoor downtown vibe. Can't argue with that. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  While they'll get you on the beers when it comes to price, what else is new for a labeled Brewery. However, the pizza, and in my case the calzone, was very reasonably priced, with only $9.50 scoring me this monstrosity.  Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Pizza is pretty straight-forward yeah? Crust, Sauce, Cheese, Toppings. Done. That's hard to mess up, but at the same time? It's difficult to master. My calzone was great, full of fresh ingredients, and others in my party were absolutely raving about their pizzas. However, I can't say it was the best I've ever had. Single Star Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  This is a tough one, but the concept is such a great one that I have to admit that Il Vicino would be on my lunch list every day if I lived downtown. Star Granted.\",\n",

To start, you order standing at the desk like a fast food joint. You aren't even waited on. Considering the $80 meal, we should get more than McDonalds service. Then, the pizzas ordered had crust that was vastly undercooked. All told we ordered three pizzas, bread, a full salad, and a calzone, and of the table of 6 of us we are less than half and took nothing home. Truly disappointed. We won't ever be back.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': 'Are you craving pizza but don\\'t want to eat cardboard?!? Not willing to settle for fast food pizza?  Try this amazing pizza joint in Old Colorado City! The area caters to the more liberal \"free-spirits\" and appears to be very dog-friendly.  Plan extra time to find parking anywhere in this area. Pizzeria Rustica is a small, quaint pizza restaurant that serves up an assortment of pizzas, liquors, salads, and Italiano appetizers and desserts.  Since everything is made to order and fresh, you will have plenty of time to converse with friends or impress you date. My soul-mate and I enjoyed dinner here on a Saturday evening around 730pm and it was full of diverse guests.  Families, children, twosomes, and a couple dogs in the patio seating area.  Although reservations are not needed, if you expect to bring large party of friends or are celebrating an event--I would call to secure seating! The host was sweet and accommodating and promptly sat us on the patio as requested.  The waitress Chelsea was patient and knowledgeable about the menu and was hustling to ensure she catered to her assigned tables.  Her recommendations were on point and I started my night off right with the Raspberry Cosmopolitan & the roasted olives and nuts on flatbread.  Delicious!  The aroma here is divine...garlic, cheese and pizza crust!  As soon as our pizza were served, the patrons beside us had googly-eyes for the delicious pizza and wanted to know what we ordered.  Folks, the pizzas were so flavorful--one of the best I have had--with fresh veggies & savory spices. You will have a couple slices leftover for a night-time snack.  Desserts are all Italiano-based so much of it is coffee-flavored and exotic. Definitely a must try for Colorado Springs!',\n",

I grew up working in excellent Italian places, so I might be a little hard to please.  I will say they always have exceptional service and I have always had good meals.  The squid ink pasta and lobster was my favorite.  Of note were the crab cake appetizers.  After living for a bit in Maryland, I quit ordering crab when not back there.  I took a gamble and ordered the crab cakes tonight.  Pretty sure they weren't blue crab, but outside of Baltimore, they were absolutely the best I've ever had; fresh real chunk crab perfectly cooked.  All in all, a solid date night spot.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': 'A Facade of Sophistication Served on a Plate of Disappointment. We all know the old saying: \"you can fool some of the people some of the time...\" Well, this time Biaggi\\'s Ristorante Italiano is not fooling me. This wildly popular Italian style restaurant draws a lot of out of town visitors, lunchtime business diners, and even small group patrons. It is packed on the weekends, in particular. Located in the convenient oasis of The Shoppes at Briargate among the the other themed chains and popular shopping storefronts, is what seems to be a venerable location for an always dependable meal. Sadly, things have changed. The greeting staff, comprised of two or three young ladies focused more on creating an air of exclusivity rather than getting folks to their table as efficiently as possible, are a bit too full of themselves for this typically laid-back Colorado clientele. The ambiance is somewhat upscale, though a little sterile with that distinctive \"shopping mall\" formulaic feel. I have been here about ten times over the past several years, and have noticed a decidedly steep decline in service and food quality. My wife and I were here for a \\'pre-Valentine rush\\' dinner, and so were most other diners. Our server, though genuinely well-intentioned, was stilted, confused, and struggling the entire evening. He took forever to bring us some water, then our drinks, and even jammed us with our soup and salads all at once. Clearly, he was not properly trained. I ordered the \\'Olive Me\\' martini with stuffed olives and Bombay Gin. It was way under portioned, barely reaching the middle of the glass, and missing the added vermouth I requested. The olives were a nice touch though, as all three were filled with either blue cheese, anchovies, or pepperoni. It was a welcomed twist on my usual three olive standby. My wife had a dry Californian Pinot Grigio that she thoroughly enjoyed. The special soup for the evening was a wonderful white asparagus with puréed carrots and root vegetables in a perfectly balanced cream base. Understated, bright and flavorful, it was the best part of the meal. The Caesar salad was heavily dressed, loaded with shaved Parmesan and most memorable for the undertone of biting and bitter spice from a strong, peppery chili sauce of some kind. Perhaps it appeals to the nouveau palate, but not ours. My wife\\'s sea scallops were served seared and aligned on a tiny layer of creamy risotto, flaked with crabmeat, but unfortunately ringed with an overpowering, super garlicky basil pesto that supplanted any hope of the scallop flavor from shining through. It was a heavy-handed, clumsy attempt at what should have been a better contrived dish. My eggplant Parmesan was equally disappointing. The large slices of eggplant were so thick that they did not cook through and were still green on the edges, and way over battered and too chewy to eat. The so-called tomato cream sauce, was super thick, pasty, and brash with a distinctive acidic flavor, but void of any actual cream. The topping Parmesan cheese spent too much time under the Salamander Broiler and was charred to black, instead of a more appealing light brown. Even the side of their signature Sicilian meatballs were very tough, undercooked with pink sausage pork vividly evident in the middle of one, and each needing to be ground more finely during the preparation. The concept of using what was an admittedly delicious, spicy sausage base, was ruined by terrible execution of a simple rustic meatball. The result was a complete fail on this dish. Our bill was $75 before tip, and the meal turned out to be frustratingly mediocre for a place that purports to serve sophisticated Italian fare. Others continue to flock to Biaggi\\'s, so it is entirely possible we could be missing something in the translation. But I doubt it. Salut!',\n",

This was the third time we tried this restaurant, and also the third fail! 2 of the visits, they completely screwed up the gluten free order and brought gluten filled plates. The manage came over tonight and asked to buy me a salad while I waited and my daughter ate.... We had already had salad and appetizers. It took them 30 minutes to fix the screwed up dish. Neither time did the manager apologize or take anything off the bill!!!!! The first time we went, the food was cold and the hostess was super rude. The service at this place is SLOW and poor... We tried it a third time, because once the food arrives, it is actually pretty decent. But the slow service, lack of attention and constant mistakes are not worth a return trip.',\n",

Going in I thought I'd found a gem - getting true New York style pizza in Colorado - but then this was quite a disappointment. I took the pizza home & even though I kept it on my seat by the time I got home the toppings were all over the place. This means the cheese & the toppings weren't baked in fully. The taste wasn't all that great either, probably on par or lower than Dominos.  I felt this place was just as expensive, if not more, than the pizza places in New York. So all-in-all it wasn't the best experience.\",\n",

They have two registers but decided to only use one and of course a family of four in front of me doesn\\'t know what they want and they hold the other three people behind them up. The guy in front of me was also picking up a pizza. After we waited in line for 15 minutes he stated \"my wife loves there pizza but they have the worst customer service.\" I feel the same way. I like Richard Skorman, his politics, and what he does for our community but I will NOT BE BACK to Poor Richards. If they develop a system of picking up a pizza I might consider it but until then I will be going elsewhere.',\n",

After being in town for a week for a conference and staying at a nearby hotel I was delighted to stumble across poor Richards restaurant, cafe, and shops. I have been here nearly every day whether it be for a used book, pizza (twice!), or coffee and coconut macaroons. Pizza is excellent- the crust is just the right amount of chewy and crunchy. The menu has many vegetarian/vegan friendly options with apparent fresh ingredients. Their bakery items are delicious.   I was also very impressed with the service. People seemed to really take pride in providing a good customer experience, were friendly, and worked quickly to churn out orders during a steady dinner hour. The atmosphere is terrific as well. They have several patios (front and back) and a relaxed ambiance inside. One of the nights I was here there was acoustic music. I will be mentioning this place anytime I ever hear any mention of 'colorado springs' and will remember it as a wonderful part of my trip to Co springs! I urge you to head to poor Richards NOW!!\",\n",

       "        'review_text': \"I love Delis, I really do; and while Mollica's is worth a stop for the unique European products, it's a bit iffy when it comes to the actual sandwiches.  Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  It looks like other Yelpers have experienced some issues with the service, but my server was very pleasant. From there, the atmosphere is great, with abundant space and some unique grocery items that aren't common in a Safeway or King Soopers. My sandwich came out quick, so no complaints here. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  When I hop into a local deli, I'm expecting to pay a bit more than say Subway or Jimmy John's. This being the case, I didn't give it a second thought when my Pastrami Sandwich came to $8.18.  Huge? No. Heavy on the meat? Not really, but you get a small side salad with your sandwich, which saved the day here portion wise. Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  While my sandwich was good, I can't say the meat or the bread was better than what I've had in the past. The bread was beaten out by nearby South Jersey Subs, and the meat didn't have me wishing I'd ordered a second. Single Star Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Nah. With Drifter's, Chipotle, etc. so close, this really isn't anything special. No Star Granted.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': \"Stay Focused On Their Specialties. Mollica's Italian Deli has remained laser focused on what they do best for many years now. I first ate here about four or five years ago and it as been a while since I have returned. Nothing has changed really, except for the prices, which are dizzyingly high for the freshly cut cold cuts. How they can demand 22 bucks a pound for provolone cheese is beyond my comprehension...who's paying that? Anyway, the Italian subs are still relatively high quality, made with fresh, chewy bread, fine cold cuts, and just the right amount of dressing. It is their staple product and is still among the very best in the city. The sausages are homemade, authentic and pricey at 10 bucks for five with marinara sauce. I get the need to remain committed to quality, but these are not proper, old school, in-shop, hanging aged meat from the ceiling, deep village Brooklyn Italian Deli products these folks are selling. They are mere Boar's Head commercial products in most cases--though a handful are imported. I get frustrated by price gouging and found any other offerings besides the sub sandwiches, which are already pretty sporty at nearly 10 bucks each, as way too expensive for real people to afford. I cannot grasp how they stay in business with that kind of a pricing structure. Therefore I recommend we as consumers stay focused as well, and stick exclusively to the sub sandwiches at Mollica's, otherwise you will find yourself overspending for mediocrity.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': 'You can taste the freshness. Having wanted to try what Mollicas was all about, and having visited them twice before only to find they were closed, I finally hit paydirt on Monday this week. My wife was at work, so that left me with baby duty with the twins. Coming inside, I had one in each hand, but was gratefully helped by the busser who seemed to be the most helpful and friendly person on the staff. I say this because all other workers (who I\\'m sure are paid more than the busser) stood and stared as I went about my business trying to get some high chairs ready at my table.\\r \\r After that was all settled, I went to the counter to order. I noticed a large assortment of subs available in 4\" (around $4) and 8\" variety. Each came with a side of pasta salad unless you wanted something different (I don\\'t know what else they had). So I ordered the two subs they\\'re most famous for, the Grinder (sausage) and the Dominic (meatballs), a drink and a large cannoli. The sandwiches came out very hot, with perfectly crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside bread. The meat for both (which is made in house) was absolute perfection. The freshness permeates throughout as you can taste each spice used to make their meat. Speaking of the sausage and meatballs, I must have been eating a lot of crappy pre-made storebought stuff in other restaurants because these meats just melted in my mouth. Literally requiring no chewing. The tomato sauce used was equally as fresh with no salt or sugar trying to hide or take away what is just a naturally good sauce.\\r \\r The pasta salad was just okay, nothing good or bad to say about it. Well, except they used a small amount of red onions which I hate. But to be honest, it came with so little that I didn\\'t care. My only comment on the cannoli is their extremely reasonable prices when compared to Dat\\'s Italian for literally half the price ($3.50 versus $6.89). I could taste no difference.\\r \\r So in the end, I would definitely recommend Mollicas to the discerning Italian sub enthusiast. So far, I can\\'t find another place in town that touches them.\\r \\r As a final note, the prices noted here on Urbanspoon have all gone up since the menu was last posted. My meal came to a total of $15.01 for everything I talked about when all was said and done.',\n",

There were 5 of us, we were seated at a table for 4 with a chair on the end which put me into the aisle with people walking by bumping me constantly. Put in our order and waited 40 minutes for the food to arrive, during which time the server and the manager came by and apologized multiple times without us complaining about the wait. Food was marginal, I ordered the \"late night burger\" which was advertised as \"smothered\" with chile verde, when it arrived there was barely any on it, certainly not smothered. I sent the server back for more twice before it was acceptable. Then the gift card I had was run incorrectly so I had to pay cash out of pocket for no reason. I won\\'t go back to BJ\\'s at any point in the future. Not worth the trouble or expense.',\n",

From there the expeeience falls off the cliff. There were 4 of us and we all spent a great deal of time looking over the large menu. I, as is my norm, wanted to go straight for the signature of the place. It actually took some reading to figure out it was a deep dish pizza type place. I ordered BJ's favorite mini and added a Cesar salad. For being a signature dish I was grealty disappointed. There is no sauce, most if the fillings seemed under cooked and had no real flavor at all. It honestly paired right up there with a dry sandwich. The salad was okay bust some of the lettuce was slimy. My wife ordered the broccoli cheese soup. It was barely Luke warm and truthfully tasted like microwaved canned soup. By her third spoon it was cold. My sons opted for differnt choices one with a steak and the other a chicken club sandwich... lets just say the veggies and fries were cold, the mashed potatoes tasted like food service boil in a bag type and the fries had a hint of fish to them. All toll we spent $64 (no alcohol) before tip and honestly we all left feeling a bit peckish. Just wasn't impressed at all. My advice, hit noodles and company across the parking lot for an $8 thai hot pot or buttered noodles.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': \"Demonstrably Formulaic & Perfectly Predictable Equals a Big Meh. America loves its brand names because they are familiar and consistent. Breaking into that cultural echelon is not easy for new businesses and product lines. BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is awfully familiar and reminiscent of several other similar brew pubs and houses I have frequented lately. It is built in a warehouse structure with faux side panels, garage door windows and partitions and an industrial ceiling. There is a decidedly recurring theme of the obligatory list of six or eight selections of house Pilsners, IPA's, Porters and Lagers, each described by bitterness and hoppyness and color and caramel. BTW, am I the only one who thinks $7 for a unremarkable draught beer is bit much? Methinks the charm and luster of all these supposedly exclusive craft beers has worn off, as they are becoming rather ordinary and overpriced. I can get an equally satisfying six pack of Sam Adams' for a few dollars more. The related menu typically offers some peppery calamari, spicy fries, cheesy chips, creamy pastas, and smoky meats. They all have variations on the same theme, with desperately few offering their own opus to a memorable experience. Sure, these places are fun and sociable, but they have also become routine and predictable as a springtime snow fall in Denver. I'll go down the list to satisfy those who want to know how the rundown of pub food actually measured up. The calamari, with marinara and horseradish dippers were fine, salty, crispy and made fresh to order--though a bit skimpy in portion for the price. The fettuccine with chicken and broccoli and the shrimp scampi with linguine are adequate, perfectly satisfying but certainly nothing special. The New York sirloin is a fair price and can be paired with some very good Brussels sprouts with bacon lardons. The burgers are mediocre and cooked properly, while the pulled pork is a reheated, though sufficiently tangy sandwich topped with limp onion strings and a conflictingly sweeter commercial bbq sauce that seems to clash with the more vinegary pork sopping marinade. Each of those are sided with joltingly fishy tasting skinny fries that are served cold, meaning they are not enjoyable at all. They need to rotate the fryolator oil. The all you can eat soup and salad for eight bucks is good, but the tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad was not made consistently: the first one was adroitly dressed with basil, a drizzle of a fine syrupy balsamic, and some fresh greens; the second was overpowered with an ill-advised array of thyme, cilantro and other off-putting herbs. There was no buffalo mozzarella added, and the tomatoes were not as flavorful on the second round. It was horrible, and simply not consistent. Someone has not been trained properly, to include the server who put it on our table without challenging the line cook regarding the inconsistency. The clam chowder, though jammed full of clam bits, was a little too thick with a flour based roux. The kid's pan pizza was doughy and had no sauce or topping worth mentioning. Subsequently, BJRBH barely rises above the most basic of standards for acceptable, and is simply another average franchise that will do if your hungry. Whatever.\",\n",

The lady who seated me was also my waitress. She was very attentive and took my order right away. The menu entry for chicken parmigiana described as \"Breaded Chicken Tenders.......\" So I ordered the lasagna and asked what the soup(s) were since I am not a salad fan. She had to go and check and it was clam chowder. The clam chowder was actually very rich and thick and I enjoyed it. The lasagna was in a little dish by itself and was probably made to order. The dish was sizzling when it arrived, but the cheese had not browned leading me to believe that a microwave was involved. The marinara sauce was rich and flavorful, and there was a lot of it. I would have enjoyed having more meat and pasta but oh well. The dish itself was OK, but not what I hoped for. I cannot say like or dislike at this point and will probably never eat here again due to living in another state.',\n",

However, I must say that since the remodel has happened the quality of food went down hill. The first time we went on Grand re opening I asked the server if they changed the marinara, of course they did, now it is salty as ever, the lasagna now has no flavor but salt and cheese. I'm very bummed about this, I gave it another try tonight and the same, all salt, I also think it tasted more acidic. There is also Alot of new staff in there that just try real hard and you cannot enjoy your meal and a conversation without someone at your table every two minutes, please bring the original sauce back!\",\n",

He knew the specials by heart and provided excellent recommendations to suit our palettes.  The portions were spot-on with freshly baked bread accompaniment.  With any restaurant that serves freshly made pasta, you will have an opportunity to sip wine and enjoy your date's company.  This is a great date night location or venue for a small group of friends.  It appears they also do catered events.  Everyone's food including my own was absolutely divine.  Can't wait to go back for more!\",\n",

Called for reservations and were seated as soon as we arrived. The waiter, Steve, introduced himself eloquently, was very courteous and professional, yet very friendly and helpful. Service was superb, wine and food fantastic! Prices very reasonable. The manager came out and personally checked on us. Very nice experience for all of us.',\n",

Restaurant ambiance is quaint, simple and clean with poster size family photos. Great for friends or coworkers, casual date or if you just want to order & pick-up.  The pizzas are tasty and fresh with focus on a selective specialty menu.  There is something for everyone (meat-eaters and vegetarians).  If you want to add-on additional toppings, that option is available.  Duca also has piadine's and salads.  Service was friendly and helpful.  One individual pizza serves 1 adult (you may have a slice or 2 leftover). Great food for a great price!\",\n",

This review is for the Cheyenne Mtn blvd place. \\r \\r The good:\\r \\r Having been to Italy (including Naples) many times, I can say this pizza is very good and pretty authentic, though not quite as good as Resturante Del Lago at the Broadmoor. The pizza is a really great value at 6.95 for a pie that will feed two! The Mediterranean salad was fantastic. \\r \\r The bad:\\r \\r Desserts were a joke. Not fresh. \"Gelato\" was a frozen solid pre packaged cup of ice cream like you get at a school cafeteria. Caloni pretty terrible, likely out of a box. This place is not a bakery/cafe.\\r \\r No bar. No wine list. Just a couple mediocre hoise wines and a few beers.\\r \\r Atmosphere: this is the most disappointing part....think slightly nicer version of Subway. Self serve. Bright lights. Not the kind of place that invites you to sit and stay awhile. \\r \\r Bottom line: authentic, well done Napoli style pizza at a great price...great salads, but take it to go.',\n",

Due to the mixed reviews we wanted to take a look at their buffet before deciding wether or not we wanted to stay and eat here (not to mention that one of us is a vegetarian). We went in and saw that there were 3 peices of a very stale looking cheese pizza and some other pasta dishes that looked as if there had been there since lunch, we were there around 6pm. We decided not to eat there and went out to our car, to look for another place to eat. It was then that this guy came out and started starting at us. This person then said \"I noticed you guys left\". I said \"Yes we didn\\'t see any pizzas and don\\'t have time to wait and noticed 4 people in the restaurant and decided to eat somewhere else\". It was then that this guy started yelling, and approaching the open window of my vehicle, that the other people ordered their own pizzas and he was making more. Again, we didn\\'t have time. Then preceded to insult the Navy plates that are on my vehicle, and started screaming that Air Force is better. Not even sure where that came from, but whatever. Good luck to anyone that decides to eat at this establishment.',\n",

I went it, found out it was $10 more than advertised, was upset, got the pizza anyway and left. Loved the pizza (it was the Chicago style deep dish, I can't speak to their regular pizza) so I got a Groupon, the Groupon says it is a flat fee which gets you a medium two topping pizza, an appetizer and two drinks, dine-in or carry out. I called and ordered this for carry out, go to pickup my order and there was a balance, the owner wanted to charge me gratuity for my carry out order, was mad I got it for carry out, said that was an error and wanted to charge me over the amount it said it was valued at. I was appalled, showed him the Groupon, and he said it was their error and I had to pay the difference. I will never come back. If you advertise a price, you honor it.\",\n",

Found a Groupon online for this place and was immediately treated poorly by the owner because of our groupon. After ordering glasses of water we waited 20 min until the owner came back to our table. He then proceeded to interrogate us on what we were going to order and how much money we planned to spend insisting he needed to make money off of us even though the Groupon didn't state we had to spend a minimum amt of $. Had he given us a chance to order, he would have known how much we were spending. Plus, the buffet was kind of pricey for the small amount of stale food they had to offer. After 15 min of listening to the owner grill us, we finally walked out and never plan to return.\",\n",

We stopped going there because my wife and I considered the food overpriced and underwhelming. Generally, that remains our impression of CPK 's current offerings. The field green salad was underdressed, bland, and needed some tang. The sweet walnuts were very good though. The Bolognese was skimpy on the sauce, too light and bright for what supposed to be a hearty, rich dish. It had no depth of flavor, lacked garlic, and the pasta was actually way too al dente and almost inedible. The wild mushroom pizza was dominated with fresh basil and a pungent wild mushroom flavor. It was surprisingly bold but did not balance with the near tasteless crust. The five cheese pizza was good, but also needed some salt and pepper and maybe some oregano to round it out. I tried their pricey sangria and it was refreshing..not to mention pricey. CPK's prices are still astronomical for what they serve you, and we were once again reminded why we do not like the food, nor consider their prices a value for the average family. We will not return anytime soon.\",\n",

You can expect a trendy interior, a large, varied menu and a formal waitstaff. \\r \\r The CPK specializes in \"personalized\" pizza\\'s that ring in around 12\" in diameter and have toppings you wouldn\\'t normally find at other pizza places. Just look at my Thai pizza for example. No tomato sauce here, instead, it\\'s a peanut sauce. It comes with scallions, chicken, sprouts, etc. It was pretty tasty with all of the flavors going nicely and reminding me of, guess what, Pad Thai.\\r \\r My wife\\'s 3 topping pizza was also pretty good. The sauce was just enough and had the traditional California style sweet sauce. The sausage had nice, noticeable fennel seeds in it, which made it seem more premium.\\r \\r I like their traditional crust, which was crunchy and very chewy with a slight hint of sweetness to it. I really enjoyed it. And best of all, it wasn\\'t dusted with that damn corn meal like Extreme Pizza does.\\r \\r I\\'d recommend CPK to people who would insist on a chain restaurant, but also because I don\\'t believe there is a local pizza joint that specializes in California Style pizza in the Springs.',\n",

Colorado Springs Food Guy visited Panino’s 1721 S 8th St, Colorado Springs CO 80905 based on a suggestion from one of my Facebook friends. Panino’s is a casual, family-style restaurant with an upbeat atmosphere. I sampled their most popular item, the Grinder Panino, along with the Barbeque Panino, Manicotti, and the Italian Platter. The Grinder and Barbecue Paninos are overstuffed, lightly toasted wraps filled with an assortment of meats, and other flavorful ingredients. The Manicotti was baked to perfection. The Italian Platter offered generous portions of old-style Italian favorites such as Lasagna, Eggplant Parmigiana, and Spaghetti with Meatballs. Brian was my server and he was very attentive and energetic. The Manager and host were very welcoming, making it no wonder why this restaurant has become a staple in the community for so many years. I also tried an Italian Margarita served over ice with a salty rim.\\xa0 It was mixed perfectly and delicious. Simply, Panino’s does family-style Italian right with reasonable prices, big portions, and scrumptious food. \\xa0So next time you want a family night out in search of a hearty meal, visit Panino’s. I had a wonderful dining experience.',\n",

       "        'review_text': \"Bella Panini is a family owned Italian restaurant with amazing pizza, pasta, beer and wine nestled in Palmer Lake CO. This little cafe style restaurant reminds me of hitting the little Trattorias in Italy. They have a nice small patio out front and the inside is light and modern with wood floors, just enough art and the tables are nicely spaced. After having not so great 'Italian' food the other night I was still craving some good pasta. The night was a bit cool so we opted to sit inside and were seated in a little alcove by the window which made for a great 'date' night spot. Often these tucked away tables can be forgotten but not here. Our waitress Kelsey was so nice, friendly and helpful all night and not just to us but to all her tables.  \\xa0  The place was packed with several large parties on a Thursday night but as we walked to our table the food looked amazing. Lucky for us we were hungry so got to try a good sampling of the food.  We started off with a bottle of the Fantini Farnese Sangiovese. Deep ruby color with notes of leather, cherry, cranberry, tobacco and earth aromas; dry, medium-bodied, with velvety texture and ripe cherry flavors. It was a great choice in the mid-price range. I will be adding a few bottles of this to my own collection. Kelsey also brought out some wonderful bread, fresh from the oven with a nice crispy exterior and their house-made balsamic dipping sauce. A great start!  Dare we say after a terrible Caesar salad that we decided to give it a whirl for a second night in a row. Whew, glad we did. This was a nice big bowl meant for sharing with crisp romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese and croutons with a wonderful light dressing (and not too much or too little) with a hint of anchovies. I asked for a side of anchovies and was quickly brought a small bowl of them. Another thing I really liked about the service here was that we were brought salad plates AND forks. A pet peeve (as a former server) is using your entree fork and then it either not being replaced or the server asking you to keep it. Nice touch.  The absolute highlight and I mean highlight is the pizza. It is days later and I am still thinking about that pizza. We ordered a bar size Godfather as an appetizer. Olive Oil, Roasted Garlic, Mozzarella, Ricotta Cheeses and Bella Spices plus we added chicken and mushrooms. That Ricotta cheese knocked this pizza out of the park. Super thin crust (I usually leave the ends...not this time) and I was amazed that the center was as crispy as the outside (usually the outside is crispy and the inside is a bit soggy). I wish we had ordered the large! It came with cute bowls of Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. This pizza is straight from Italy...HEAVEN. They also have a Gluten Free crust for those that are interested. Hands down to date the best pizza in the Springs area.  We came hungry and I mean hungry so we both ventured onto the pasta side. I opted for the Sicilian Style Beef Cannelloni which was Beef Braised in Red Wine, Stuffed into Pasta and Baked in a Tomato and Roasted Vegetable Sauce with Bechamel. My, oh, my..the red wine sauce was so deep and rich with fork tender beef encased in a sheet of perfectly cooked pasta. I ate half, took half home put an egg on top for breakfast the next day. Again, to showcase the great service, Kelsey had put 2 pieces of the bread in the to-go container. Top notch throughout the whole experience.  My hubby had the spaghetti combo with homemade meatballs and Italian sausage. The meatballs were delicious. Moist, perfectly seasoned and held up wonderfully in the homemade marinara sauce. The sausage was your typical Italian sausage with a good hint of fennel (we want to try this on the pizza next time). The red sauce was fresh and had a perfect balance. Not too acidic and with a hint of sweetness. The pasta was cooked to perfection. They also have a full line of Gluten Free pasta items to choose from.  \\xa0I know all the desserts are homemade but we were packed and called it a very happy night. It is worth the drive and even a wait for this Italian food and exceptional service.\",\n",

Being from the east coast I know what this kind of pizza should taste like. The problem is the service is terrible and the atmosphere is shot. It was ok when it opened but it just has a let it go feel to it, almost kind of dirty. Last time there I sat down and tried to order the special on the board. The waitress said that's not the special that's from the other day. Ok, it's written in chalk, there's two people in the restaurant, it's already 2pm way past lunch with staff standing around and your too lazy to erase to put the actual special on the board. This is service 101, I've opened numerous restaurants over the years and it doesn't matter how good your food is, if the service stinks you're going down in flames. Probably wouldn't go back and the sad part is I like the pizza.\",\n",

Their newer Timberline location is a hot mess though. It's been open a couple months at least so I can't chalk it up to growing pains anymore. Anyway.  Placed a simple three piece order via online app. It estimated a two hour wait. I thought that was a little ridiculous for a Monday but at least they gave me a heads-up. THREE hours later I call them to check on it. The young woman was nice but had no idea what was going. She couldn't tell me if my order was ever put in, if it out for delivery, or anything. She just said 'well it's not here'. Hmm.  Luckily while I was getting ready to go pick something else up for dinner the delivery person appeared. I realize a three hour wait is not a delivery person's fault so I wasn't expecting anything there but when he arrived he just held the bag out, said 'here', stood there watching, and the said 'sign'. That was it. Haven't been into the Timberline location though, maybe it's better that way. I still LOVE the other location.  -------------------------------------------------  One of my favorite spots in Fort Collins.  The wings are the best wings in town.  The raspberry chipotle is delicious. The salads are enormous a half salad is more than I can eat. The pizzas have great toppings and the crust always comes out just right.  They aren't gourmet pizzas but they are some of the best in town.  It can get busy since it's right beside campus and quite popular, especially on nights with specials.  I keep trying other wing places out of curiosity and keep coming back to Krazy Karl's.\",\n",

We have lived in Loveland, CO for 6 years now, and I can say that this is the WORST MEAL we have had here. Ordering was an ORDEAL; 20 minutes of searching online for BASIC INFORMATION like a MENU, A PHONE #, HOURS? Chalk it up to A busy day/busy hour. Mother's Day. Must have caught them by surprise, right? The pie itself was an out-sized disk maybe half-covered with the sparsest of ingredients, smeared with pink sauce, and little evidence of cheese and no herbs. It was cold upon pick-up, and our oven (ready at 200 degrees) was no help. The price was absolutely ABSURDLY high. An ALL-OUT DISASTER. HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, MOM!\",\n",

As a student at UNC, friends say, \\\"Let's go to Roma\\\" on a very frequent basis and I refuse to understand why so many people like it. \\r \\r The Pizza is pretty good, but unless you have one of the 50% off coupons it's pretty over priced for what you get. The lunch specials are a good deal but the quality of the food is never amazing. The All-You-Can Eat Spaghetti is probably the best deal, but the noodles are cold and only half cooked nearly every single time.\\r \\r Bazooka's are massive in size and good in theory; tons of booze for $8 near a college campus. Makes sense. But only if the bartenders knew how to properly mix drinks. I've been a bartender and server for a long time and there are specific alcohol and mixer ratios you're supposed to shoot for, and the bartenders seem to just pour and pour and pour the liquor. I like a good strong and stiff drink, but some of the drinks I've had here are beyond tolerable for alcohol content. \\r \\r The worst part of this restaurant is the service (and honestly, to no fault of the servers). Why does it always take an hour and forty minutes to receive a 10\\\" personal pizza? Why does the bar always take 10+ minutes to get a drink? I work in the service industry so I'm very understanding and always polite, but Roma just pisses me off sometimes. \\r \\r It is evident to most people working in the service industry that it's not the fault of the servers, rather the fault of management to hire enough workers to handle the business this restaurant receives. Roma is busy nearly all the time, yet they probably have 4-5 servers working for 90ish customers, and two visible cooks. It's insanity. Management should take the hint that lower prices in a college environment equal higher volume profits and better service provided by more wait and kitchen staff will also increase customer volume. I'm sure they're only paying them tipped wage anyways, so it's not like adding on 4-5 more part time servers would be draining on store profits. Roma management needs to get it together. I really hate when friends suggest to go there because I've yet to be even moderately pleased in the four years I've attended UNC and patronized this restaurant.\",\n",

On September 18th 2014 the food was okay but not as good as I remember it. Service was AWFUL!!! It was so bad I have contacted cooperate. I'm retired military and the young man (very young looking maybe 19) who served us refused to wait on me after he denied my brother in law a beer for having an out of state temporary ID. First of all if your a college town maybe you should do research on out of state ID's to know which ones are valid and not valid. Afterwards he was so afraid to wait on us for saying no to a beer that he refused to come back and get my drink order along with my sister. WE sat there with ID's in hand waiting. I was so mortified because I had talked this place up and dragged my Sister, Brother in law, Uncle, and Grandpa there. All of us were over the age of 30. Youngest person at the table was 30!!!! I tried to get the managers attention and the waiter he looked at me and walked away! If your not going to serve an adult beer because your afraid of an out of state LEGAL ID with a picture the least you can do is get everybody else's drink order instead of running away and ignoring the table all together! obviously this place to \\\"upiddy\\\" to cater to \\\"older\\\" people and maybe the college students working there only care about other college students. Honestly that's what it looked like to me. FYI manager was flirting with female staff who also looked young and naive he did not care about the service WE received. I will never go back and spread the WORD.\",\n",

We were in no hurry so though we noted the service we brushed it off. I ordered a cranberry salad and my husband ordered the Beaugetti Pizza (deep dish with spaghetti and meatballs).\\r The dough was cooked separately, pasta loaded in so it really shouldn't have taken long. Prepwise it didn't. Our server however left it at the window to take and full a drink order for a table that came after us, then brought them their food.\\r When we finally got our food it was bland, I mean ice berg lettuce hidden under a cap of mixed greens, and undoctored red sauce from a can bland. The only thing either of us could say we enjoyed from the experience was the outer crust of the pizza pie.\",\n",

We think they misplaced our order or something, because the people next to us got their food, ate and left before we even GOT our pizza. Indeed, it took an hour to get our food. We only had an hour to eat and go, so we basically got our food and had it boxed. Later (when I actually tried my food), I found that the inside of the \\\"braided\\\" crust was raw! As in completely uncooked pizza dough, the outside of which was barely even toasty! NOT the best of experiences, to say the least.\",\n",

It is served with homemade garlic bread which is crispy on the outside & tender inside ad enhances the dip... Best portobello mushroom ravioli... All pasta is fresh - homemade in the restaurant... Fettuccine with pesto and crispy chicken was amazing as well as the Old World Spaghetti- highly recommend- reminiscent of dishes in Italy!!! Resonant prices as well!\",\n",

It is a bit off the beaten path but I am very glad we stopped by. Very charming atmosphere and great specials on bottles of wine for the winter. I split a ribeye steak and lasagna, both were amazing. The steak and garlic mashed potatoes were perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I took a leap of faith off of a reccomendation with the lasagna. As an Italian I am very picky with my lasagna but this was-dare I say it- better than my grandma's! The sauce was very flavorful and paired perfectly with the egg noodles. For dessert we ended with an Irish coffee (very strong!), a cheesecake, a canoli (my favorite, the ricotta was so fresh!) And a butterscotch panna cotta (so creamy and good, I don't normally go for butterscotch but this was fantastic. ) We will definitely be coming back!\",\n",

Then we had a child who only likes cheese on her pizza. Twice now we have ordered pizza with a request that part be made without any toppings besides chesse - fairly routine we figured and easily done at a place that makes your pizza while you wait. On both occasions, the college kid at the counter told us our request couldn't be filled (they were quite rude as well and offered no explaination as to why said request was not possible). At close to thirty dollars for a large pizza, this seems ridiculous. The only reason that they couldn't do it is either because the college staff is lazy, or the pizzas are premade and just warmed up. Either way beware, this place isn't worth our money or yours!!\",\n",

I've given it multiple chances on improving my experience there, but every visit is always the same. \\r \\r The servers there are friendly but the food itself is awful. First of all, the food always comes out cold or it takes 45 minutes to come out, even when the restaurant is not busy. I once tried their submarine sandwich, which was supposed to come with chips. Since this restaurant claims to be authentic Italian I thought it would come with their own special baked chips. Nope. I was given a bag of expired Lays potato chips. On a separate occasion out the meal was average, but the final straw for us was this: a live fly in our Parmesan cheese shaker! Literally a living fly walking inside the shaker. We told our server and she didn't even care! She just looked at it and said, \\\"that's not good,\\\" and then just walked away. Didn't replace it, didn't offer us an apology or even a discount. \\r \\r I've had terrible experiences every time I've gone there and I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.\",\n",

I am writing this review so you will know that following the visit that inspired my yelp review, we had a more positive experience at Santeramos. The service was as good as ever, and the food was even better. This time, the garlic toast was great. We had pizza this time, which we did not have before. The pizza was much better than I expected. Everyone really enjoyed it. I do not have an explanation for the difference in food quality. I suspect it may be due to differences in the chefs for each night. So I will be paying attention, and asking my friends, to find out who the chef is when we visit, to see if we can figure out why the quality of food was so different on two different nights. They still serve some portions that are too large, and still do not charge enough for some items.\",\n",

We tried to explain the bill add up but the owner very rudely responded and didnt agree to serve us. We asked them to show the bill register but that was refused to us. He kept saying you have eaten the pizza so I cant believe you.And he was very rude in his behaviour.\",\n",

It's one think to ask patrons not to dance, but it's another thing to yell at them and tell them you will get them arrested at a bar where dancing previously occurred every weekend. Sadly, the manager Christina had zero concern for how badly the short male waiter with a balding spot was treating everyone. The manager claimed that we could not dance in places where we blocked the aisles, but they still made us stop dancing even when we moved out of everyone's way. The short male waiter with a balding spot was talking down and ugly to over a dozen tables. I will never go back! My friends and I were previously weekly customers. I hope your staff is proud of themselves... especially when their business starts to decline significantly over the next few weeks! Wish there was an option for zero stars for this review, but there is not.\",\n",

I had their \\\"favorite\\\" Fish & Chips, which although moist, was disappointingly flavorless. The kids pizza was not good at all, and neither the kids nor adults enjoyed the cheap cardboard (overcooked pita) crust and cheddar cheese... My wife went top of the line with the \\\"butter\\\" steak, which was as you begin to suspect, not buttery at all. Hers was no better than a tough sirloin, once again with very little flavor.\\r \\r The sweet potato fries is a nice alternative, but these tasted old and slightly stale - much prefer those of Henry's just down the block.\",\n",

We sent it back once more and when it was brought back, it was without question, so over done it was almost unedible. I say almost, but for the price they were charging, we gave it the college try. My dish, the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni, well, lets just say that I'm still looking for the crab. It looked as if it was frozen food put into their own dishes. The service was good and the server was obviously embarrassed as he took 10 dollars off the ticket. We will NEVER return.\",\n",

We could hear the servers' conversations, and I'm sure they could hear ours. The service was ok--you order from the counter, including beer/wine, and wait at the table. Salad bar was decent and included dark, leafy greens and not just iceberg (which looked a little off.) Also had feta, which was a plus. We had a pepperoni pizza and The Harvest vegetarian pizza. The pizzas were ok, but between the average taste and the dead-silent Monday evening atmosphere, we were left feeling blah.\",\n",

This is an awesome place to gather with a bunch of friends for wine and food, they have a great center table for large parties. Vintages is right next door and makes an easy time of a fun filled night of wine tasting and good food after!\",\n",

Being from the east coast I know what this kind of pizza should taste like. The problem is the service is terrible and the atmosphere is shot. It was ok when it opened but it just has a let it go feel to it, almost kind of dirty. Last time there I sat down and tried to order the special on the board. The waitress said that's not the special that's from the other day. Ok, it's written in chalk, there's two people in the restaurant, it's already 2pm way past lunch with staff standing around and your too lazy to erase to put the actual special on the board. This is service 101, I've opened numerous restaurants over the years and it doesn't matter how good your food is, if the service stinks you're going down in flames. Probably wouldn't go back and the sad part is I like the pizza.\",\n",

It's been open a couple months at least so I can't chalk it up to growing pains anymore. Anyway.  Placed a simple three piece order via online app. It estimated a two hour wait. I thought that was a little ridiculous for a Monday but at least they gave me a heads-up. THREE hours later I call them to check on it. The young woman was nice but had no idea what was going. She couldn't tell me if my order was ever put in, if it out for delivery, or anything. She just said 'well it's not here'. Hmm.  Luckily while I was getting ready to go pick something else up for dinner the delivery person appeared. I realize a three hour wait is not a delivery person's fault so I wasn't expecting anything there but when he arrived he just held the bag out, said 'here', stood there watching, and the said 'sign'. That was it. Haven't been into the Timberline location though, maybe it's better that way. I still LOVE the other location.  -------------------------------------------------  One of my favorite spots in Fort Collins.  The wings are the best wings in town.  The raspberry chipotle is delicious. The salads are enormous a half salad is more than I can eat. The pizzas have great toppings and the crust always comes out just right.  They aren't gourmet pizzas but they are some of the best in town.  It can get busy since it's right beside campus and quite popular, especially on nights with specials.  I keep trying other wing places out of curiosity and keep coming back to Krazy Karl's.\",\n",

We have lived in Loveland, CO for 6 years now, and I can say that this is the WORST MEAL we have had here. Ordering was an ORDEAL; 20 minutes of searching online for BASIC INFORMATION like a MENU, A PHONE #, HOURS? Chalk it up to A busy day/busy hour. Mother's Day. Must have caught them by surprise, right? The pie itself was an out-sized disk maybe half-covered with the sparsest of ingredients, smeared with pink sauce, and little evidence of cheese and no herbs. It was cold upon pick-up, and our oven (ready at 200 degrees) was no help. The price was absolutely ABSURDLY high. An ALL-OUT DISASTER. HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, MOM!\",\n",

       "        'review_text': 'I don\\'t understand why so many people like this place.... As a student at UNC, friends say, \"Let\\'s go to Roma\" on a very frequent basis and I refuse to understand why so many people like it. \\r \\r The Pizza is pretty good, but unless you have one of the 50% off coupons it\\'s pretty over priced for what you get. The lunch specials are a good deal but the quality of the food is never amazing. The All-You-Can Eat Spaghetti is probably the best deal, but the noodles are cold and only half cooked nearly every single time.\\r \\r Bazooka\\'s are massive in size and good in theory; tons of booze for $8 near a college campus. Makes sense. But only if the bartenders knew how to properly mix drinks. I\\'ve been a bartender and server for a long time and there are specific alcohol and mixer ratios you\\'re supposed to shoot for, and the bartenders seem to just pour and pour and pour the liquor. I like a good strong and stiff drink, but some of the drinks I\\'ve had here are beyond tolerable for alcohol content. \\r \\r The worst part of this restaurant is the service (and honestly, to no fault of the servers). Why does it always take an hour and forty minutes to receive a 10\" personal pizza? Why does the bar always take 10+ minutes to get a drink? I work in the service industry so I\\'m very understanding and always polite, but Roma just pisses me off sometimes. \\r \\r It is evident to most people working in the service industry that it\\'s not the fault of the servers, rather the fault of management to hire enough workers to handle the business this restaurant receives. Roma is busy nearly all the time, yet they probably have 4-5 servers working for 90ish customers, and two visible cooks. It\\'s insanity. Management should take the hint that lower prices in a college environment equal higher volume profits and better service provided by more wait and kitchen staff will also increase customer volume. I\\'m sure they\\'re only paying them tipped wage anyways, so it\\'s not like adding on 4-5 more part time servers would be draining on store profits. Roma management needs to get it together. I really hate when friends suggest to go there because I\\'ve yet to be even moderately pleased in the four years I\\'ve attended UNC and patronized this restaurant.',\n",

I don't have high standards when it comes to pizza- I like Dominos, Pizza Hut etc- but this place was definitely the worst pizza I have had in Fort Collins. Maybe the proximity to CSU keeps this place in business?\",\n",

Can not call the restaurant to order -- have to use Order UP-- delivery took 1 hour and 48 minutes (with a 60 minute forecast when ordered); Thru the Order UP -- not clear on how to order our preference on crust; Pizza was cold when delivered; Manager at Beau Jo's did not care -- offered a $10 refund on a $65 order. Too many better places for pizza; we are regular Sunday nite pizza customers and will not go back to Beau Jo's;\",\n",

       "        'review_text': 'Horrible!. I used to go here years ago before they moved Across the street in Fort Collins. On September 18th 2014 the food was okay but not as good as I remember it. Service was AWFUL!!! It was so bad I have contacted cooperate. I\\'m retired military and the young man (very young looking maybe 19) who served us refused to wait on me after he denied my brother in law a beer for having an out of state temporary ID. First of all if your a college town maybe you should do research on out of state ID\\'s to know which ones are valid and not valid. Afterwards he was so afraid to wait on us for saying no to a beer that he refused to come back and get my drink order along with my sister. WE sat there with ID\\'s in hand waiting. I was so mortified because I had talked this place up and dragged my Sister, Brother in law, Uncle, and Grandpa there. All of us were over the age of 30. Youngest person at the table was 30!!!! I tried to get the managers attention and the waiter he looked at me and walked away! If your not going to serve an adult beer because your afraid of an out of state LEGAL ID with a picture the least you can do is get everybody else\\'s drink order instead of running away and ignoring the table all together! obviously this place to \"upiddy\" to cater to \"older\" people and maybe the college students working there only care about other college students. Honestly that\\'s what it looked like to me. FYI manager was flirting with female staff who also looked young and naive he did not care about the service WE received. I will never go back and spread the WORD.',\n",

So one day we decided to try it out for lunch. \\r We were shown to our table by a hostess who seemed like she had dozens of better things to do (it was not busy), five minutes later a server appeared to ask us what we wanted to drink. We were in no hurry so though we noted the service we brushed it off. I ordered a cranberry salad and my husband ordered the Beaugetti Pizza (deep dish with spaghetti and meatballs).\\r The dough was cooked separately, pasta loaded in so it really shouldn't have taken long. Prepwise it didn't. Our server however left it at the window to take and full a drink order for a table that came after us, then brought them their food.\\r When we finally got our food it was bland, I mean ice berg lettuce hidden under a cap of mixed greens, and undoctored red sauce from a can bland. The only thing either of us could say we enjoyed from the experience was the outer crust of the pizza pie.\",\n",

We think they misplaced our order or something, because the people next to us got their food, ate and left before we even GOT our pizza. Indeed, it took an hour to get our food. We only had an hour to eat and go, so we basically got our food and had it boxed. Later (when I actually tried my food), I found that the inside of the \"braided\" crust was raw! As in completely uncooked pizza dough, the outside of which was barely even toasty! NOT the best of experiences, to say the least.',\n",

We had great service,so we decided to go back this year. Again, it was great. I don't know why I'm seeing bad reviews here. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Estes Park.\",\n",

Watched another customer get up and wander the restaurant looking for someone that worked there to give him his check. He was still sitting there when I left. Kitchen needs an ass kicking to say the least. I would board the doors if I owned the place. Do not eat here if you have a tongue and eyes and a nose you will regret it.',\n",

It is a bit off the beaten path but I am very glad we stopped by. Very charming atmosphere and great specials on bottles of wine for the winter. I split a ribeye steak and lasagna, both were amazing. The steak and garlic mashed potatoes were perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I took a leap of faith off of a reccomendation with the lasagna. As an Italian I am very picky with my lasagna but this was-dare I say it- better than my grandma's! The sauce was very flavorful and paired perfectly with the egg noodles. For dessert we ended with an Irish coffee (very strong!), a cheesecake, a canoli (my favorite, the ricotta was so fresh!) And a butterscotch panna cotta (so creamy and good, I don't normally go for butterscotch but this was fantastic. ) We will definitely be coming back!\",\n",

Then we had a child who only likes cheese on her pizza. Twice now we have ordered pizza with a request that part be made without any toppings besides chesse - fairly routine we figured and easily done at a place that makes your pizza while you wait. On both occasions, the college kid at the counter told us our request couldn't be filled (they were quite rude as well and offered no explaination as to why said request was not possible). At close to thirty dollars for a large pizza, this seems ridiculous. The only reason that they couldn't do it is either because the college staff is lazy, or the pizzas are premade and just warmed up. Either way beware, this place isn't worth our money or yours!!\",\n",

I\\'ve given it multiple chances on improving my experience there, but every visit is always the same. \\r \\r The servers there are friendly but the food itself is awful. First of all, the food always comes out cold or it takes 45 minutes to come out, even when the restaurant is not busy. I once tried their submarine sandwich, which was supposed to come with chips. Since this restaurant claims to be authentic Italian I thought it would come with their own special baked chips. Nope. I was given a bag of expired Lays potato chips. On a separate occasion out the meal was average, but the final straw for us was this: a live fly in our Parmesan cheese shaker! Literally a living fly walking inside the shaker. We told our server and she didn\\'t even care! She just looked at it and said, \"that\\'s not good,\" and then just walked away.

I am writing this review so you will know that following the visit that inspired my yelp review, we had a more positive experience at Santeramos. The service was as good as ever, and the food was even better. This time, the garlic toast was great. We had pizza this time, which we did not have before. The pizza was much better than I expected. Everyone really enjoyed it. I do not have an explanation for the difference in food quality. I suspect it may be due to differences in the chefs for each night. So I will be paying attention, and asking my friends, to find out who the chef is when we visit, to see if we can figure out why the quality of food was so different on two different nights. They still serve some portions that are too large, and still do not charge enough for some items.\",\n",

First time I tried Garlic Knot. Ordered a $15.50 specialty pie - the \"Combo Tour\". I would have been better off with a frozen $4.99 Annie\\'s, that\\'s how bad it was. First of all - 12\"? No way! Besides it\\'s puny size, it was lukewarm and dried out. In my qwest to find Fo Co\\'s best NY style delivery pizza, I tried this place based on a friend\\'s recommendation (also tried Cozzola\\'s recently, which was much better - what wouldnt be? - but no great shakes).',\n",

It's one think to ask patrons not to dance, but it's another thing to yell at them and tell them you will get them arrested at a bar where dancing previously occurred every weekend. Sadly, the manager Christina had zero concern for how badly the short male waiter with a balding spot was treating everyone. The manager claimed that we could not dance in places where we blocked the aisles, but they still made us stop dancing even when we moved out of everyone's way. The short male waiter with a balding spot was talking down and ugly to over a dozen tables. I will never go back! My friends and I were previously weekly customers. I hope your staff is proud of themselves... especially when their business starts to decline significantly over the next few weeks! Wish there was an option for zero stars for this review, but there is not.\",\n",

The atmosphere is relaxed and it fits well into the downtown night life.\\r \\r But eating, is not nearly as interesting to me (or my family). I had their \"favorite\" Fish & Chips, which although moist, was disappointingly flavorless. The kids pizza was not good at all, and neither the kids nor adults enjoyed the cheap cardboard (overcooked pita) crust and cheddar cheese... My wife went top of the line with the \"butter\" steak, which was as you begin to suspect, not buttery at all. Hers was no better than a tough sirloin, once again with very little flavor.\\r \\r The sweet potato fries is a nice alternative, but these tasted old and slightly stale - much prefer those of Henry\\'s just down the block.',\n",

We sent it back and it was returned extremely rare, practically raw. We sent it back once more and when it was brought back, it was without question, so over done it was almost unedible. I say almost, but for the price they were charging, we gave it the college try. My dish, the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni, well, lets just say that I'm still looking for the crab. It looked as if it was frozen food put into their own dishes. The service was good and the server was obviously embarrassed as he took 10 dollars off the ticket. We will NEVER return.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': \"Ok pizza and salad bar, atmosphere blah. We were the 2nd group of diners in the large restaurant at about 6pm. After a little difficulty finding the place (in the old Elkhorn Lodge,) we thought the atmosphere was very awkward--no music or happy hum at all. We could hear the servers' conversations, and I'm sure they could hear ours. The service was ok--you order from the counter, including beer/wine, and wait at the table. Salad bar was decent and included dark, leafy greens and not just iceberg (which looked a little off.) Also had feta, which was a plus. We had a pepperoni pizza and The Harvest vegetarian pizza. The pizzas were ok, but between the average taste and the dead-silent Monday evening atmosphere, we were left feeling blah.\",\n",
